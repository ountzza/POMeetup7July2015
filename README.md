#Product ownership is a team sport 
***by Shane Hastie***

***Be Pragmatic (there is more than one more path to agile)***
##PO role scrum guild 2013
- Maximizing RIO
- Manager PO backlog 
- Developed long ago. It was meant to solve how to build stuff
- Now the problem is not building the thing right but build the right thing
- Most if us work in org that our product is complex using various solutions with various stakeholders with conflicting interests 

##Anti pattern PO exercise
- Should we have PO team 
- PO too busy
- Can't convey the 'why' to the team
- Back channel 
- What level of technical should PO be (know enough about tech if they lie + know enough about business that to know what make sense to build)

##Tips
- We can't exclude good idea no matter the source 
- There is no one size fit all
- Aim more meeting less more workshop 
	- Meeting is when you create work
	- Workshop is when you complete work

##Project type
- Complexity of problem/solution
- Enhanced existing product 
- Etc

###Cinderella project
- Best environment for agile
- Small collocation team 
- Generic skill
- Clear team reference 
- Expert engaged customer at your neck and call
- Etc

***It is fairly tails, Reality is not as good***

##The octopus model 
-  Context
  - Size
  - Critical 
  -  Business model
  - Stable architecture 
  - Team distribution 
  - Governance 
  - Rate of change
  - Age of the system 
- As a PO, we need to understand this

## Product ownership 
- Product management 
- Marketing
- Business advocates 
- Customer advocates
- End user advocates 
- Domain subject matter knowledge 
- Analysts 
- Ux 
- Innovative 
- Communication
- Legal
- Technical skill
- Testing 

###Therefor we need a team 
- Like football team, we need a captain
- should be view as Vaule Facilitator 
- Vaule manager
- Product owner 
- Product champion steward
- Initially we can start small and grow 
- In small project, this can be one person 
- PO: get things ready
- Team: get things for ready to done 

##Discussion: how do the concept of PO and team apply to your project 
- Backlog 
- InfoQ just publish an article on agile input process: a way to validate idea and turn that into the backlog
- Team captain facilities the Vaule 
- The most power PO has is the word "No"

###Decreasing queue length 
- Study: 70% or the features will never be used
- Lots of waste
- We can very efficiently building a wrong product 
- Like mining: find gem among the rock (story)
- Value vs Story point
  - Story point easy to measure
  - Value graph should be a s curve 
		- We are learning 
		- MVP
		- Values come after some learning 
		- Then start to flat out 
	- Every story point should has a link to the business value
	-  As a PO your most Vaule comes from maximizing the work undone 
	-  What we don't do enough is say "stop" 
	- If the incremental Vaule is less than the incremental cost then don't build it
	- Sometime we do it because it is none value
	- If PO is in silo, if PO don't use all the budget - they might trim it next year. 
  - Po should have a portfolios of the view 
  
##Tools and tips to help guide PO below 
###Innovation 
- The number on challenge is to create a culture of innovation - Jim highsmith 
	- In software dev today- we work on the complex problem 
    		- We buy simple one 
  		- Don't be afraid to use old and tested solution 

###Purpose alignment model (book - stand back and deliver) 
- Market different vs mission criticality 
	- Partner 
	- Excel and innovative (we want this!!)
	- Maintainance 
	- Parity (like accounting - just need to meet the standard not no point being great at)

###Vision 
***common understanding across the whole team of what the project is for and what success look like. Eg.***
- Vision box
- Kano analysis 
	- Mobile phone example 
	- So when releasing stuff we need to look at this analysis as a guide to help us cut of the minimum stories to release 

###Questions 
- Siting in a vacuum, what should I do when there is no requiremwent from a business?
	- Making stuff up
	- Reduce the technical depth 
	- Build investment 
	- Po is about making a good priotization 
	
- How do we measure the Vaule. what are the technic? Get stakeholders to understand the cost
	- Innovation bidding game 
	- To help decide where to spend
	- Sudo budget 
	- Enabler, Vaule and Waste 
	- Be careful of technical depths 

- Risk vs innovation
	- Staying still is moving backward 
	- Look at way to get a MVP
	- Validate our idea cheaply
